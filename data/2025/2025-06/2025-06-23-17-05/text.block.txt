Hotline 119  
 
The police emergency hotline 119 was introduced in 2004 with the aim of immediately 
deploying police officers in case of any disaster faced by the public or in case of an 
immediate need for assistance from police officers.  
 
However, when the recent calls reported to this hotline are concerned, it is observed that 
there are instances where this service is being misused by making false complaints and 
also making complai nts, which should be referred to other immediate services, in addition 
to complaints required immediate action by the police.  
 
Moreover, the public often make certain complaints through this hotline even though the 
said requirement can be fulfilled through  other services (complaints related to customer 
service, complaints related to bribery, complaints related to irregularities by government 
institutions, and complaints related to cases where the police assistance is not immediately 
required, such as land d isputes and financial disputes).  
 
Consequently, the accessibility to the Police Hotline 119 in an emergency situation is 
minimised, and as a result of the allocating time on unnecessary complaints, one has to be 
in a queue for a long time to submit an urge nt complaint that requires immediate police 
assistance through the 119 hotline.  
 
In connection with the lodging of such false complaints, steps have been initiated to take 
legal action against the relevant persons by reporting the facts to the Hon. Court, and in 
cases where this service has been misused, measures have been taken to temporarily 
terminate calls from the such phone number to the 119 Hotline Centre.  
 
Therefore, the police request the public to act with due understanding by identifying 
situations where police assistance should be sought immediately when using this service in 
order to receive services efficiently and effectively.
