"aising  public  awareness  for  the  prevention  of  misuse  of  the  Police  Emergency"
"Hotline 119"
"T
he  police  emergency  hotline  119  was  introduced  in  2004  with  the  aim  of  immediately"
"deploying  police  officers  in  case  of  any  disaster  faced  by  the  public  or  in  case  of  an"
"immediate need for assistance from police officers."
"H
owever, when the recent calls reported to this hotline are concerned, it is observed that"
"there  are  instances  where  this  service  is  being  misused  by  making  false  complaints  and"
"also making complaints, which should be referred to other immediate services, in addition"
"to complaints required immediate action by the police."
"M
oreover, the  public  often  make  certain complaints through this  hotline even  though the"
"said  requirement  can  be  fulfilled  through  other  services  (complaints  related  to  customer"
"service, complaints related to bribery, complaints related to irregularities by government"
"institutions, and complaints related to cases where the police assistance is not immediately"
"required, such as land disputes and financial disputes)."
"C
onsequently,  the  accessibility  to  the  Police  Hotline  119  in  an  emergency  situation  is"
"minimised, and as a result of the allocating time on unnecessary complaints, one has to be"
"in  a  queue  for  a  long  time  to  submit  an  urgent  complaint  that  requires  immediate  police"
"assistance through the 119 hotline."
"I
n  connection with the  lodging of such false complaints, steps have  been initiated to take"
"legal  action  against  the  relevant  persons  by  reporting  the  facts  to  the  Hon.  Court,  and  in"
"cases  where  this  service  has  been  misused,  measures  have  been  taken  to  temporarily"
"terminate calls from the such phone number to the 119 Hotline Centre."
"T
herefore,  the  police  request  the  public  to  act  with  due  understanding  by  identifying"
"situations where police assistance should be sought immediately when using this service in"
"order to receive services efficiently and effectively."
