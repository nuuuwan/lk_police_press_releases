Letter of Gratitude to the Interpol, Indian and Indonesian

Authorities.

It is with great respect, that the Sri Lanka Police will convey our sincere appreciation to the Interpol, Indian and Indonesian Agencies, for their untiring efforts, support and also guidance to make the Indonesian Mission a success.

If not for their interaction, the attempt to get these most wanted criminals by the Sri Lanka Police would have been unproductive.

We are very much proud to have had and also to continue the very close association with the Interpol, Indian and Indonesian Agencies in order to strengthen the trustworthiness, mutual understanding and the cooperation for the betterment of all our countries.

We are ready to assist, corporate and give a hand to curb any illegal activity that has been witnessed even currently and in future in our regions.

Please do convey our sincere appreciation and blessings to all who sacrificed, devoted to make this operation a success.
