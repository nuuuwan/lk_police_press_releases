Clarification Regarding a Circulating Message Falsely Attributed to Sri Lanka Police.

Sri Lanka Police wish to inform the general public that a message currently circulating on social media and messaging platforms, titled as a “Police Notice” and containing a list of safety instructions, has NOT been issued by Sri Lanka Police. The contents, wording, and directives in that message are unauthorised and misleading, and the public is advised not to treat it as an official police communication.

However Sri Lanka Police remain fully committed to maintaining law and order and ensuring the safety and security of all citizens across the country.

* The public is urged to verify information before sharing messages, especially those claiming to be from government institutions.

* Official police announcements are released only through verified channels, including:

* Sri Lanka Police official website

* Press Releases by Police Media Division

* Verified Sri Lanka Police social media accounts

* Recognised media outlets

Spreading unverified or false information can cause unnecessary fear and may disrupt public order.

Sri Lanka Police will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure public safety and request the cooperation of the public in maintaining peace, harmony, and lawful conduct throughout the country.

For accurate and up-to-date information, please rely only on official Sri Lanka Police communications.
